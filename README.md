# Data-Analysis-week-7-Assignment
Objective For this Assignment:  
To load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library in Python. 
To create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data.

📊 Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment
Overview

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using Python. The dataset used is the Iris dataset (a classic dataset from scikit-learn), which contains measurements of iris flowers across three species.

The analysis is divided into three main tasks:

Data Loading & Exploration

Basic Data Analysis

Data Visualization

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or a Python script (.py), and follows the instructions provided in the assignment.

📝 Tasks Completed
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Displayed the first few rows (.head()) to inspect the data.

Checked data types and missing values.

Cleaned the dataset by confirming no missing values exist.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Computed summary statistics (.describe()), including mean, median, and standard deviation.

Grouped data by species and calculated the average petal/sepal measurements.

Identified patterns such as differences in measurements across species.

Task 3: Data Visualization

Created four different types of plots:

Line Chart – trend of petal length for the first 50 samples.

Bar Chart – average petal length by species.

Histogram – distribution of sepal length.

Scatter Plot – relationship between sepal length and petal length.

All plots are customized with titles, axis labels, and legends.
